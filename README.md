# Project Motivation:
Detecting so-called “fake news” is no easy task. First, there is defining what fake news is – given it has now become a political statement. If you can find or agree upon a definition, then you must collect and properly label real and fake news (hopefully on similar topics to best show clear distinctions). Once collected, you must then find useful features to determine fake from real news.

# What is fake news

“Fake news” has been used in a multitude of ways in the last half a year and multiple definitions have been given.
