## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Detecting so-called “fake news” is no easy task. First, there is defining what fake news is – given it has now become a political statement. If you can find or agree upon a definition, then you must collect and properly label real and fake news (hopefully on similar topics to best show clear distinctions). Once collected, you must then find useful features to determine fake from real news.
In my project, my main motivation is to find out whether a news article it is fake or not. At the end, the user will know the probability of the news being fake or not.
